                Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen (A. P. J.) Abdulb
                Kalam (15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was
                the11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. A
                career scientist turned politician, Kalam was born
                and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and
                studied physics and aerospace engineering. He
                spent the next four decades as a scientist and
                science administrator, mainly at the Defence
                Research and Development
                Organisation (DRDO) and
                Indian Space Research
                Organisation (ISRO) and was
                intimately involved in India’s
                civilian space programme and
                military missile development
                efforts. He thus came to be
                known as the Missile Man of
                India for his work on the
                development of ballistic
                missile and launch vehicle technology. He also
                played a pivotal organisational, technical, and
                political role in India’s Pokhran-II nuclear tests
                in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by
                India in 1974.
